    <p>Vibe Mode stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your timer duration preferences, theme selection, and notification preferences</li>
        <li><strong>Blocked Sites:</strong> Your list of websites to block during focus sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Session Statistics:</strong> Count of completed sessions, streak data, and session timestamps</li>
        <li><strong>Active Session State:</strong> Current timer status and end time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
